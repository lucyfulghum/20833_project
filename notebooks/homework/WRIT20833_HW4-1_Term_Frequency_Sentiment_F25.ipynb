        "This assignment marks your first extensive analysis of a text-heavy dataset of your choosing. The goal is not just to run analytical tools, but to experience the process of moving from assumptions to data-driven insights. You'll practice forming hypotheses, testing them against actual data, and allowing your understanding to evolve based on what you discover.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our digital age, we're constantly exposed to two very different paths to forming opinions and understanding the world. One path leads from genuine phenomena through careful data collection and analysis toward real insight, knowledge, and wisdom. The other path starts with social media impressions and moves through cherry-picked evidence and narrative scaffolding toward rigid ideological positions. Through this assignment, you'll experience the first path—the harder but more rewarding journey of letting data challenge and refine your thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Philosophy**: Being \"wrong\" in your initial predictions is not a failure—it's a sign of genuine learning and intellectual growth. The best insights often come from discovering that reality differs from our assumptions. When your data surprises you, that's when real learning happens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Collaboration Policy**: You may work together with classmates to solve technical challenges and discuss methods, but each student must choose their own unique dataset and complete their own analysis."
